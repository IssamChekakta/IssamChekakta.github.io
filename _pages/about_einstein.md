A postdoctoral research associate in control and optimisation within the Rolls-Royce University Technology Centre (UTC) at the University of Sheffield. I hold a PhD in Automatic and Systems from one of the leading national universities in Algeria, the University of Ferhat Abbas SÃ©tif-1. During my final year (2022-2023) as a PhD student, I served as a Teaching Assistant for the Vibrations and Waves course. My PhD works were conducted under the co-supervision of researchers from the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, France (Prof. Kevin Guelton as a co-supervisor, Dr. Koffi Motchon as a research collaborator). I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Automation and Control in petrochemical industries from the University of 20 August 1955 Skikda, Algeria, in 2016 and 2018, respectively. My primary research focus is on hardware accelerators for optimisation and control, model predictive control, fuzzy and nonlinear systems, estimation and filtering techniques.
